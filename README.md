# FmodTest
 This version of my FMOD into Flax intergration is not the most ideal way of achieving the support, as it still runs the OpenAL audio along side it all, however, I may in the future have a tamper with the engine its self and try to intergrate support that way. Feel free to use this project as a template but just a reminder, ***its very basic and not the most ideal implementation!***
